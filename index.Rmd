## Project thoughts

I am interested in predicting this years winner of the Great British Baking Show. I will be using data collected by watcher

To investigate the factors correlated with winning I will be using data from

1. Alison Hill's "bakeoff" package: "The goal of bakeoff is to enable data wrangling, analysis, and visualizations with R using data from “The Great British Bake Off”. https://github.com/apreshill/bakeoff or https://bakeoff.netlify.app/


I will attempt to estimate the winner of this years bake off based on the correlations.
